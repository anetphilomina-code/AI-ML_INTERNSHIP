# AI-ML INTERNSHIP

This repository contains the projects I completed during my internship.  
All the work was done using **Python** in **Google Colab**.

## Repository Structure

The projects are organized by week folders:

- **[Week 1](./week01)**
- **[Week 2](./week02)**
- **[Week 3](./week03)**

> ⚠️ Folders are named with leading zeros (`week01`, `week02`, `week03`) to ensure proper order on GitHub.
