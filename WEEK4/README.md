# 📝 Blog Generator App

This project is part of my **AI-ML Internship (Week 4)**.  
The **Blog Generator App** is a Streamlit-based web application that uses the **Groq API with the LLaMA language model** to generate high-quality blogs from user prompts.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Blog Generator App allows users to:
- Enter a **topic or prompt** for the blog.
- Generate complete blog content instantly using **AI**.
- Adjust creativity level via **temperature settings**.
- View and copy the generated blog directly from the app.

It provides an interactive interface for content generation using **Streamlit** and **Groq’s LLaMA model** for text completion.
